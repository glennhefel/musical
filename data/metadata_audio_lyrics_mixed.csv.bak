que no hay mañana sin esa ilusion por creer
no hay nada que detenga ya tus pasos
los brazos en alto el temor a un lado amor como aliado

que nadie impedira que alcancemos objetivos por mucho que lo intenten si he querido yo he podido

y he podido porque la fuerza esta conmigo
aunque digan que yo no puedo llegar yo les digo no
es el camino que yo elijo

hay que escapar y regresar al equilibrio
buscar un nuevo brillo y la ilusion de cuando niños
las ganas de vivir y de aprender que ya perdimos
yo lo hago con pasion encerrada entre estribillos
tu encuentra tu lugar en este mundo en que vivimos
porque no hay quien me diga lo que tengo que hacer
si yo he querido crecer y me olvidado del ayer

que la vida es tan corta asi que vamos despierta
olvida lo que no importa invierte el tiempo

no dejo de pensar en ti espero que tu también
yo estoy muy bien no niego que un poco triste
no saco de mi cabeza lo que tu me prometiste

si algo sentiste a veces me pongo a pensar
si verdaderamente conmigo querias estar
pero no vo' a negar que todavia te quiero
aunque ha pasado tiempo en mis brazos te espero

pues hay muchos recuerdos que yo tengo en mi mente
mis palabras mienten si dicen que nada sienten
presente en tu vida para siempre quisiera estar
juntos caminar y a tu lado despertar

y no puedo soportarlo mas no puedo estar no puedo estar sin ti
cuando te vi por primera vez te vi por primera vez
no pensé que me rendiria a tus pies
aqui estoy recordando y no te dejo de pensar
no te logro olvidar y te quiero besar
volver a recordar lo que fuimos tu y yo

aqui estoy recordando y no te dejo de pensar
no te logro olvidar y te quiero besar
volver a recordar lo que fuimos tu y yo
lo que fuimos tu y yo

ningun dia yo te dejo de pensar
como el tatuaje en mi piel en mi vida vas a estar
quiero llegar a ser el hombre que tu quieres
dime que mas hago tienes un hombre que se muere

por darte amor respeto y todas esas cosas
alguien que sin pensarlo te daria miles de rosas
eres hermosa un recuerdo que me mata
hiciste algo en mi vida que a tu amor mi ata

quiero volver a vivir volver a sentir
juntos sonreir si un error cometi lo quiero corregir
contigo compartir el amor descubrir
no voy a fingir que me muero por ti

a tu lado reir hasta el dia de morir
no te voy a mentir un amor para ti
yo te voy a elegir yo te voy a seguir nunca me voy a ir
para que te des cuenta que te amo a ti
y sabes bien que me muero por ti
di di di eh
que me muero por ti

no puedo estar sin ti
cuando te vi por primera vez te vi por primera vez
no pensé que me rendiria a tus pies

hasta las nubes hoy mienten
y te explota en la cabeza
una tremenda tormenta

fuerte
abrazame muy fuerte
mi amor nunca me sueltes
ay que extraña es tu manera de quererme
que lindo que seria estar con vos y conversar

de cosas
no se de cuales cosas
cosas poco importantes y es que es muy duro olvidarte
no me digas que aun no nos veremos
y tendremos que esperar

mas tiempo
decime cuanto tiempo
si pareciera que no hubiera nada
y haga lo que haga
no paro de extrañarte
y de perderte cada dia mas

y el amor es asi
cuando lo dejamos ir
se resiente feo con tu alma
y ya no te deja ni dormir

y es como una venganza
por si el vacio no te alcanza
y te deja de recuerdo
en la guitarra
una de contra puta cancion

vieja
viejas canciones viejas
sonrisas que se alejan de mi cara
la angustia me apuñala
y mi rostro ya refleja
chotos miles años de dolor

canas
se vino el carmelazo
no me banco el fracaso de perderte
y tal vez fue para siempre
aquello que hoy me tiene
hundido en esta seca soledad

y quisas en ese lugar
nos volvamos a encontrar
quisas no sea tan malo
si al final los dos
nos la re mil buscamos

quiero prepararme mejor
a la altura de la ocasion
solo un rato mas de amor
para respirarte corazon

vente que conmigo es diferente
siente conmigo amor y abrazame fuerte
y no pidamos perdon
por todo lo que nos paso

que ahora ya no es importante
mucho mas peor fue tratar de olvidarte
que tremendo que se siente
sensaciones tan crocantes tan crujientes

y de repente estoy dado vuelta
como un condon o media
como un coreano en la feria
como un morron en la leche
como navidad el quince de septiembre

y al fin me resigno
y veo que no todo es tan maligno
como bola sin manija
y mi apnea no me ayuda
esa es fija

দুজনার দুটি পথ মিশে গেল এক হয়ে নতুন পথের বাঁকে।।
সে এক নতুন দেশে দিনগুলি ছিল যে মুখর কত গানে
সেই সুর কাঁদে আজি আমার প্রাণে

ভেঙ্গে গেছে আজ সেই মধুর মিলন মেলা

সারা দেশে শান্তি নাই, ফকির লালের ঘুম নাই

এই দেশেতে মানুষ নাই
এই দেশেতে মানুষ থাকলে
মানুষের কি চোখ নাই?
স্বাধীনতার দাম নাই, মুক্তিযোদ্ধার মান নাই
দেশ প্রেমিকে চাইয়া দেখে
এই দেশেতে উপায় নাই
এই দেশেতে ঠাঁই নাই
এই দেশেতে মানুষ থাকলে
মুজিব হত্যার বিচার চাই।।
একাত্তরের দালালরা হুশিয়ার সাবধান
অস্ত্র থাকে কাপুরুষের, লাল বাহিনীর র‌্যাপ গান
ধর্মের নামে ধান্ধাবাজি এই শালারা বেঈমান
মূর্খ মানব মন্ত্রি হইছে, লাত্থি মাইরা চেয়ার ভাঙ
রাজনীতিতে রাজা হইছো, রক্ত হাতে মুসলমান
ফকির লালে শালিস ডাকছে আলবদরগো ডাইকা আন
স্বাধীন দেশে বোমা মারে, মারবার আগে আরেকবার
বুতাম শার্টের খুলা আগে লালের বুকে বোমা মার
দেলু দালাল দাড়ি রাখলে মানুষ কিন্তু বদলে না
মুসলমানের বাচ্চা আমরা আল্লাহ রসুল শিখাইস না
ভাইরা আমার রক্ত দিছে এই কথাটা ভুলিস না
সরকার খেলে কানামাছি চোখে দালাল দেখে না
কিয়ামতের ময়দানেও লালে তোগো ছাড়বো না
বাংলা Rap এর বন্দুক হাতে খুদার কসম বাঁচবি না
ভুল তো করে সবাই কিন্তু কিছু ভুলের মাফ নাই
ভাইরা আমার জীবন দিছে আলবদরগো বিচার চাই।।
শহীদ জিয়া (?) স্মৃতি স্বরুপ কিছু কথা লেখতে চাই
হঠাৎ কইরা কি যে হইলো, কাগজ আছে কলম নাই
পঁচাত্তুরের মীরজাফর, বাঙালিরা ভুলে নাই
কলম হাতে ঠিকই লালের বাঁইচা গেছস লেখে নাই
হুমকি দিয়া কি লাভ মিয়া, ফকিরের আর কিসের ভয়
রক্ত হাতে চশমা চোখে, খুনি কেমনে শহীদ হয়?
চামচিকারে বাংলাদেশে কে বানাইলো মাতব্বর?
লাল সবুজে শরীল ঢাকা, সব শালারা মীরজাফর
জয় জয় পাকিস্তান, জয় জয় মুসলমান
দালালরা সব ঐক্যজোটে দেশ বানাইছে গোরস্তান
ষড়যন্ত্রের শিকার কিন্তু বঙ্গবন্ধু মরে নাই
মার্চ মাসের ভাষণ আমি ঘুমে থাইকা শুনতে পাই
থানা পুলিশ ডাইকা আনো, খুন-খারাবি করতে চাই
বঙ্গবন্ধু বাঁইচা আছে, বাঙ্গালিরা বাঁইচা নাই
শেখ হাসিনার দলে আমি ভর্তি হইতে আসি নাই
আমি একজন বাংলাদেশি, মুজিব হত্যার বিচার চাই।।
কলম হাতে ফকির লালের আজকে যদি মৃত্যু হয়
আমার খাতায় জীবন যুদ্ধের এটাই সবচে’ বড় জয়
কথার দিছ দুকান খুইলা আমার কওয়ার আছে কি?
ইচ্ছামতো দেশ চালাইলে গণতন্ত্রের দরকার কি?
মাইরা ধইরা আছে যা সব খা তাতে আমার কি?
চাউলের কেজি তিরিশ টাকা দিনমজুরে খাইবো কি?
কৃষক, শ্রমিক উপোস থাকলে স্বাধীনতার মূল্য কি?
তুমার ভাই, আমার ভাই, ফাইজলামির আর সীমা নাই
সব ভাইরেই দেখা আছে, কোন ভাইরে বিশ্বাস নাই
বন্দুক নিয়া ঘুরলে কি লাভ গুলি যদি ফুটে না?
পুলিশ থাইকা দেশে কি লাভ ডাকাইত যদি ধরে না?
লালের যত মাথা ব্যাথা আর কি দেশে মানুষ নাই?
সালাম, রফিক রক্ত দিছে রাষ্ট্রভাষা বাংলা চাই
ওদের স্বপ্ন সফল হওয়ায় আমার কুনো কষ্ট নাই
মতিউরের জাহাজ ভাঙছে, স্বপ্ন কিন্তু ভাঙে নাই
আজকে দেশে মানুষ আছে, একটা খালি প্রেমিক নাই।।
সারা দেশে শান্তি নাই, ফকির লালের ঘুম নাই
