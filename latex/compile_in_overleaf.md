This folder contains content for a NeurIPS 2024-style report.

How to use with the official Overleaf template:

- Open the NeurIPS 2024 template project.
- Replace the template's main .tex file with latex/main.tex (or copy/paste its contents).
- Upload the folder latex/figures/ and latex/references.bib.

Local compilation note:

- This repo does not include neurips_2024.sty. Local compilation requires copying the style file from the official template into latex/.
